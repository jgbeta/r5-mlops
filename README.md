# r5-mlops
# R5 MLOps - General Overview

## Main for consideration:

**Inference Scalability:**
- Container platforms for efficient scaling: Kubernetes.
- Deploy models as Kubernetes pods or EC2 instances.
- Use AWS Auto Scaling for efficent resources use.
- Distribute incoming requests with AWS Elastic Load Balancer.

**Machine Learning CI/CD:**
- Implement automated CI/CD pipelines for model deployment and versioning.
- Version control systems: Git.
- Infrastructure definition: AWS CloudFormation or Terraform.
- Define and include include automated testing and integration tests.
- CI/CD implementation: Jenkins or AWS CodePipeline.

**Model Validation (Data Drift and Model Drift):**
- Data drift and model drift monitorin and detection: AWS SageMaker Model Monitor / Evidently 
- Compare data distributions for drift detection.
- Trigger retraining based on model drift performance metrics.

**Data Versioning:**
- Establish data versioning guidelines and strategies for consistency and traceability.
- Use tools like DVC or AWS Glue DataBrew for tracking changes.
- Store data in versioned repositories like AWS S3 or AWS Glue Data Catalog.
- Associate trained model versions with input data versions.

**Model Continuous Training:**
- Implement continuous training to improve models over time.
- Set up regular retraining schedules based on business needs.
- Use frameworks like AWS SageMaker for scalable training pipelines.
- Integrate automated retraining into CI/CD pipeline.

**Logging and Monitoring:**
- Implement comprehensive logging for inference requests, errors, and performance.
- Use centralized logging solutions like AWS CloudWatch Logs or ELK stack.
- Set up monitoring and alerts using AWS CloudWatch Metrics, Prometheus, or Grafana.

**Security and Compliance:**
- Implement robust security measures for models, data, and infrastructure.
- Apply access controls and encryption mechanisms.
- Ensure data privacy and prevent unauthorized access.
