# R5 MLOps - General Overview

## Main Points:

**Inference Scalability:**
- Utilize container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes for efficient scaling.
- Deploy models as standalone Kubernetes pods or EC2 instances.
- Use AWS Auto Scaling for dynamic infrastructure scaling.
- Distribute incoming requests with AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB).

**Machine Learning CI/CD:**
- Implement automated CI/CD pipeline for model deployment and versioning.
- Utilize version control systems like Git for code management.
- Define infrastructure with AWS CloudFormation or Terraform.
- Include automated testing and integration tests.
- Use Jenkins or AWS CodePipeline for CI/CD orchestration.

**Model Validation (Data Drift and Model Drift):**
- Set up monitoring to detect data drift and model drift.
- Compare data distributions for drift detection.
- Perform regular retraining or use online learning techniques.
- Utilize AWS SageMaker Model Monitor or TFDV for monitoring.

**Data Versioning:**
- Establish data versioning strategy for consistency and traceability.
- Use tools like DVC or AWS Glue DataBrew for tracking changes.
- Store data in versioned repositories like AWS S3 or AWS Glue Data Catalog.
- Associate trained model versions with input data versions.

**Model Continuous Training:**
- Implement continuous training to improve models over time.
- Set up regular retraining schedules based on business needs.
- Use frameworks like AWS SageMaker for scalable training pipelines.
- Integrate automated retraining into CI/CD pipeline.

**Logging and Monitoring:**
- Implement comprehensive logging for inference requests, errors, and performance.
- Use centralized logging solutions like AWS CloudWatch Logs or ELK stack.
- Set up monitoring and alerts using AWS CloudWatch Metrics, Prometheus, or Grafana.

**Security and Compliance:**
- Implement robust security measures for models, data, and infrastructure.
- Apply access controls and encryption mechanisms.
- Ensure data privacy and prevent unauthorized access.
